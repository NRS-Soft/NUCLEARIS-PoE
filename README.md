<a name="usage"></a>

## Usage

The nuclear components used in nuclear installations require a lot of documentation to **verify the high standards** under which those components were fabricated.

Nevertheless the industry works and **trusts in its entirety in physical paper**, which is _not resistant to counterfeit_.

We want to provide a solution to this problem, offering a way for the supplier to save the documentation in a digital format and decentralized way and for the client to **trust in the documentation he receives**.

And at the same time the client should be able to find and verify the documentation of components which fail or don't meet up to the defined standards.
